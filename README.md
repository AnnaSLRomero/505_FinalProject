This is testing item recognition memory.
Participants are shown 10 images in the beginning of the block.
Afterwards, they are tested on all the images plus 5 new images. They are to press 1 if they saw the image before ("old" condition) and they have to press 2 if was not presented earlier ("new" condition). Therefore, overall there are 15 images during testing.

The stimuli I am using are screenshots of the unity assets we are currently using in our VR videos. We want to test item recognition for objects we have created in our scenes and I wanted to see if we could do this through psychopy.

The images are to be presented for 1500 msecs or 1.5 seconds during the presentation stage. During testing, the image will stay up until "1" or "2" are pressed. 

In the csv file that is created at the end records the Trial (no block, because there is only 1 block), the accuracy, and response time of the participant.
